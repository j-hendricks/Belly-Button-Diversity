# Belly-Button-Diversity

## Overview

This webpage visualizes data of bacterial samples, which were extracted from the navels of over 100 participants. The goal is to determine which navel-residing bacteria are in sufficient abundance for use in a novel branch of scientific research, which aims to mass-produce certain bacteria for creating meat-alternative food products. Such research will ultimately broaden vegetarian and vegan food options, as well as feed the world's growing population without increasing society's carbon footprint, unlike the meat industry.
